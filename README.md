# Bun CLI Template

This repository is a template for creating a new CLI project that runs using the Bun runtime but with my (`@4lch4`) preferred setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NOTE: When you create a new project from this template w/ Boilerpate this `README.md` and the `Taskfile.yml` file will be deleted. The README will be replaced with the new project's README file, based off the `README.template.md` file.

## Usage

In order to "properly" use this template you have two options, both of which require you to install [the Boilerplate CLI tool][2] from [Gruntwork][3]:

- Run the required `boilerplate` command to create a new project using this template:

```sh
boilerplate --template-url <path-to-clone-of-this-repo> --output-folder <path-to-save-output>
```

- Install my (`@4lch4`) Sebastian CLI tool and use it to create a new project from this template:

```sh
sebastian create project
```
